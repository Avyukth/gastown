Fresh-context review phase for polecat work submissions.

This molecule is assigned to a FRESH polecat context to review work completed
by another polecat (the Worker). It implements the Reviewer phase of the
Worker → Reviewer pattern, ensuring quality gates are verified by a separate
agent with clean context.

## Worker → Reviewer Pattern

```
┌──────────────┐   TASK_ID    ┌──────────────┐   gt done    ┌──────────────┐
│    WORKER    │ ───────────► │   REVIEWER   │ ───────────► │   REFINERY   │
│   (impl)     │   COMMIT     │ (fresh ctx)  │              │   (merge)    │
└──────────────┘              └──────────────┘              └──────────────┘
```

## Why Fresh Context?

- Worker context is polluted with implementation decisions
- Fresh eyes catch issues the implementer is blind to
- Separation of concerns: implement vs verify
- Matches human code review patterns

## Variables

| Variable | Source | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| task_id | handoff | The bead ID of the work being reviewed |
| commit | handoff | The commit SHA marking end of worker phase |
| branch | derived | The branch containing the work |
| test_cmd | config | Test command (default: auto-detect) |
| lint_cmd | config | Lint command (default: auto-detect) |

## Language Detection

The reviewer auto-detects the project language and applies appropriate checks:
- **Go**: go test, golangci-lint
- **Rust**: cargo test, cargo clippy
- **Python**: pytest, ruff/flake8
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: npm test, eslint
- **Generic**: User-provided commands via variables

## Failure Modes

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| TDD pattern violated | Document violation, request worker fix OR fix directly |
| Banned pattern found | Fix directly, commit as fix(review): |
| Weak test found | Fix directly, commit as fix(review): |
| Tests fail | Investigate: worker bug or pre-existing? Handle accordingly |
| All checks pass | Proceed to gt done |"""

Initialize review session and load the work to be reviewed.

**1. Prime your environment:**
```bash
gt prime                    # Load role context
bd prime                    # Load beads context
```

**2. Check your hook for review assignment:**
```bash
gt hook                     # Shows review assignment
bd show {{task_id}}         # The work being reviewed
```

**3. Verify the branch and commit:**
```bash
git fetch origin
git log --oneline {{commit}}^..{{commit}}  # Verify commit exists
git checkout {{branch}}     # Switch to the branch
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD        # See all commits to review
```

**4. Understand scope:**
```bash
git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD         # Files changed
git diff origin/main...HEAD                # Full diff
```

Check that commits follow good practices (NOT strictly TDD unless project requires it).

**1. Review commit history:**

**2. Check for good commit discipline:**

| Good Pattern | Red Flag |
|--------------|----------|
| Atomic commits (one logical change) | Giant "WIP" or "fix" commits |
| Clear commit messages | "asdf", "stuff", "update" |
| Type prefixes (feat/fix/refactor/test) | No context in message |
| Issue reference where appropriate | Unrelated changes mixed |

**3. For TDD projects (if configured), verify cycle:**
```bash
# Look for test → implementation → refactor pattern
git log --oneline | head -20
# Should see interleaved test/feat/refactor commits

**4. Document findings:**

- These are advisory unless project enforces strict TDD

Search for patterns that should not appear in production code.

**Auto-detect language and scan:**

The patterns below are examples. Adjust based on detected language.

**For Rust projects:**
```bash
# Stubs that panic at runtime
grep -rn "todo!()\|unimplemented!()\|panic!()" src/ --include="*.rs" || true

# Lazy error handling
grep -rn "\.unwrap()" src/ --include="*.rs" | grep -v "_test\|tests\|#\[test\]" || true

# Dead code suppression
grep -rn "#\[allow(dead_code)\]" src/ --include="*.rs" || true
```

**For Go projects:**
```bash
# Panic in production code
grep -rn "panic(" --include="*.go" | grep -v "_test.go" || true

# Ignored errors
grep -rn "_ = \|_ :=" --include="*.go" | grep -v "_test.go" || true
```

**For Python projects:**
```bash
# Bare except clauses
grep -rn "except:" --include="*.py" | grep -v "except:\s*#" || true

# Pass in except blocks (swallowed errors)
grep -rn -A1 "except" --include="*.py" | grep "pass" || true

**For TypeScript/JavaScript:**
```bash
# Type assertions that bypass safety
grep -rn "as any\|@ts-ignore\|@ts-expect-error" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" || true

# Empty catch blocks
grep -rn "catch.*{}" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" || true

**Action on findings:**
- **Critical (panic/crash paths):** Fix directly → `git commit -m "fix(review): remove panic in production path"`

Check that tests are meaningful, not just present.

**1. Identify new/changed test files:**
```bash
git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD | grep -E "test|spec|_test" || true

**2. Scan for weak test patterns:**

**Generic weak assertions (all languages):**
```bash
# Tests that only check "not error" without verifying value
grep -rn "assertNotNull\|assertNotNil\|!= nil\|!== null\|is not None" \
  --include="*test*" --include="*spec*" || true

**Rust-specific:**
```bash
# Weak Result checks
grep -rn "\.is_ok()\|\.is_some()\|\.is_err()" \
  --include="*test*.rs" | grep "assert!" || true
# Should use: assert_eq!(result, Ok(expected)) or matches!

# Look for error/failure/invalid test cases
grep -rn "test.*error\|test.*fail\|test.*invalid\|test.*empty\|test.*nil\|test.*null" \
  --include="*test*" --include="*spec*" -i || true
